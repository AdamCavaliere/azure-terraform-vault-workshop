How to Provision an Azure VM
-------------------------
<br><br><br>

Let's look at a few different ways you could provision a new Azure Virtual Machine. Before we start we'll need to gather some basic information including:

.biglist[
1. Virtual Machine Name
1. Operating System (Image)
1. VM Size
1. Geographical Location
1. Username and Password

  "osProfile": {
    "computerName": "[variables('vmName')]",
    "adminUsername": "[parameters('adminUsername')]",
    "adminPassword": "[parameters('adminPassword')]"
  }
```

ARM templates provide a consistent and reliable way to provision Azure resources. JSON is easy for computers to read, but can be challenging for humans to edit and troubleshoot.

Each cloud has its own YAML or JSON based provisioning tool. 

Terraform can be used across *all* major cloud providers and VM hypervisors.

Terraform vs. JSON
-------------------------

ARM JSON:
```json
"name": "[concat(parameters('PilotServerName'), '3')]",
```

Terraform:
```hcl
name = "${var.PilotServerName}3"
```

Terraform code (HCL) is easy to learn and easy to read. It is also 50-70% more compact than an equivalent JSON configuration.

Chapter 1  
Set Up Your Workstation
]

---
name: workstation-setup-1
Log Onto Your Workstation
-------------------------

Your instructor will provide you with a workstation URL that looks like this:

.center[.h1[myworkstation01.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com]]

.center[![:scale 50%](images/rdp_login.png)]

Use Remote Desktop (RDP) to access your workstation. Your instructor will provide the username and password.

???
Note to the instructor - outbound access on TCP port 3389 is required for this to work. Always have someone at the client check that they can access a test workstation *before* you go on site. You don't want to show up for training and find out that RDP access is blocked from the network you're using.

RDP is installed by default on almost all Windows corporate PCs and laptops. If your students are on Mac they can download the official Microsoft RDP client from the app store.

---
name: workstation-setup-2
Run the setup.ps1 script
-------------------------

<br><br><br>
.center[![:scale 50%](images/run_setup.png)]

Right click on the file called 'setup' on your desktop and select 'Run with Powershell'. Type Y for Yes when it asks about changing your execution policy.

???
If anyone is curious what this powershell script does, it's disabling windows line endings for git clone, and installing the posh-git powershell extension. We may add more setup steps to this script as time goes by.

---
name: workstation-setup-3
Open Visual Studio Code
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/set_colors_and_icons.png)]

Click the little gear icon in the lower left corner. You can adjust your Color Theme, File Icon Theme, and other settings such as Font Size. Choose a color theme and font size that are comfortable for you.

???
I like to demo this part for the students. My personal favorites are Dracula and vscode-icons. Be sure and reload if you add any new extensions or themes.

---
name: workstation-setup-3a
Warning Message
-------------------------
<br><br>
.center[![:scale 70%](images/renderer.png)]

If you see this warning message just select 'Yes'. Visual Studio Code works better with the DOM-based renderer on remote workstations.

---
name: workstation-setup-4
Install the Terraform Extension
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/install_terraform_extension.png)]

Click the box shaped icon on the left side menu. This brings you to the Extensions Marketplace. Search for Terraform. Install the first one on the list. Click the 'Reload' button once it is done installing.

---
name: workstation-setup-5
Open the Integrated Terminal
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/open_terminal.png)]

Open the integrated VSC terminal using the menu or keyboard shortcut. You'll be asked to choose a default shell the first time you do this. Select Powershell as your default shell. You can change this later in your settings if you wish.

---
name: workstation-setup-6
Clone the Training Repo
-------------------------
<br><br>
Run the following commands to clone the training repository from GitHub:

```powershell
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/scarolan/azure-vault-terraform-workshop
cd azure-vault-terraform-workshop
```

Now reload your text editor in the current directory with the code command:

```powershell
code -r .
```

---
name: workstation-setup-7
Get to Know Visual Studio Code
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/vsc_tour.png)]

* Left side: File browser, search, version control & more.
* Lower right: Integrated terminal. Run all commands here.
* Upper right: Open and edit multiple files in tabs.

---
name: workstation-setup-8
Explore the Repository
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/terraform_config_files.png)]

Terraform configuration files always end in either a `.tf` or `.tfvars` extension. These files are marked with the purple Terraform icon if you are using the vscode-icons set.

???
This is a good time to explore the VSC text editor a bit. Show your students that you can do almost everything from within the editor. You can expand and collapse the file browser. Show what each icon on the left side of the GUI does. You can also point out that the terminal can easily be maximized or minimized. 

---
name: workstation-setup-10
Verify That Terraform is Installed
-------------------------
<br>
Run the terraform --version command:

```powershell
terraform --version
```

You should see the following output (version number may vary):

```powershell
PS> terraform --version
Terraform v0.11.11
```

My First Terraform
]

---
name: terraform-init
Run Terraform Init
-------------------------
Run the `terraform init` command in your Terminal:

Command:
```powershell
terraform init
```

Output:
```tex
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget,
other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Terraform fetches any required providers and modules and stores them in the .terraform directory. You can take a peek inside that directory where you'll see the plugins folder.

---
name: terraform-plan
Run Terraform Plan
-------------------------
Run the `terraform plan` command in your Terminal. Terraform will prompt you to set the required prefix variable. Enter your name in all lowercase letters.

Command:
```powershell
terraform plan
```

Output:
```tex
var.prefix
  This prefix will be included in the name of most resources.

  Enter a value: bugsbunny

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.
```

???
The terraform plan command says "No Changes" because we haven't defined any infrastructure yet. 

---
name: set-prefix
Set the Prefix Variable
-------------------------
Rename the terraform.tfvars.example file to terraform.tfvars. Change where it says "yourname" to your own name. No spaces or special characters please. Keep it all lowercase. Save the file.

```tex
# Rename or copy this file to terraform.tfvars
# Prefix must be all lowercase letters, no symbols please.

prefix = "yourname"
```

Now you will no longer be prompted to enter your prefix variable when you run terraform commands.

The terraform.tfvars file is your own personal settings file. You can use it to set or override any of the default variables in the variables.tf file.

---
name: defining-variables
Where are Variables Defined?
-------------------------
Open up the variables.tf file and you can see all of the defined variables. Note that some of them have default settings. If you omit the default, the user will be prompted to enter a value.

Here we are *declaring* all the variables that we intend to use in our Terraform code.

```tex
variable "prefix" {
  description = "This prefix will be included in the name of most resources."
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The region where the virtual network is created."
  default     = "centralus"
}

variable "address_space" {
  description = "The address space that is used by the virtual network. You can supply more than one address space. Changing this forces a new resource to be created."
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

---
name: chapter-2-lab
Lab Exercise 2A: Set the location variable
-------------------------
Choose the Azure location nearest to you and set the 'location' variable. You can find a list of Azure locations here:

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/locations/

Examples:
```
centralus  - Iowa, USA
eastus     - Virginia, USA
westus     - California, USA
uksouth    - London, UK
southindia - Chennai, India
chinaeast  - Shanghai, China
```

---
name: chapter-2-lab-answer
Lab Exercise 2a: Answer
-------------------------
Your variables.tf file should now look similar to this:

```tex
# Rename or copy this file to terraform.tfvars
# Prefix must be all lowercase letters, no symbols please.

prefix = "yourname"
location = "uksouth"
```

name: main.tf
Terraform Comments
-------------------------
Open the main.tf file in the VSC file browser. You'll notice that the entire file is full of comments. There are two types of comments:

Line Comments begin with an octothorpe<sup>*</sup>, or pound symbol: #
```hcl
# This is a line comment.
```

Block comments are contained between /\* and \*/ symbols.
```tex
/* This is a block comment.
Block comments can span multiple lines.
The comment ends with this symbol: */
```
<br><br><br><br>

\* Yes, it really is called an [octothorpe](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/octothorpe).
]

---
name: anatomy-of-a-resource
Anatomy of a Resource
-------------------------
Every terraform resource is structured exactly the same way.

.center[![:scale 80%](images/resource_anatomy.png)]

*resource* = top level keyword

*type* = this is the name of the resource. The first part tells you which provider it belongs to. Example: `azurerm_virtual_machine`. This means the provider is Azure and the specific type of resource is a virtual machine.

*name* = arbitrary name to refer to this resource. Used interally by terraform. This field *cannot* be a variable.

???
Everything else you want to configure within the resource is going to be sandwiched between the curly braces. These can include strings, lists, and maps.

---
name: resources-building-blocks
Resources - Terraform Building Blocks
-------------------------
Find the first resource in the main.tf file on lines 18-21. Highlight these four lines and uncomment them.

You can do this with the _Edit > Toggle Line Comment_ menu, or by simply pressing `CTRL-/`

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "vaultworkshop" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-vault-workshop"
  location = "${var.location}"
}
```

Resources are the smallest building blocks of Terraform. Think of them as declarative statements about what you want to build. Save the main.tf file.

Note that the resource contains references to the two variables we set in the previous chapter, location and prefix. These will be replaced when we run terraform commands. Variables are always enclosed in a dollar sign and curly braces.

---
name: terraform-plan
Everything Starts with a Plan
-------------------------
Run the `terraform plan` command and observe the output:

Command:
```powershell
terraform plan
```

Output:
```tex
------------------------------------------------------------------------
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop
      id:       <computed>
      location: "centralus"
      name:     "yourname-vault-workshop"
      tags.%:   <computed>


Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

???
Terraform plan is a dry run. This is a good time to talk about how Terraform can give you a preview of what would be built if you actually ran the apply subcommand. Terraform plan gives you a chance to have other people review and approve your changes before you apply them.

---
name: terraform-graph
Terraform Graph
-------------------------
<br><br><br>
Let's take a closer look at what Terraform wants to build. Use the command palette menu, or the CTRL-SHIFT-P keyboard shortcut to bring up the Command Palette.

.center[![:scale 60%](images/command_palette.png)]

---
name: terraform-graph-2
Terraform Graph
-------------------------
<br><br><br>
Start typing 'terraform' into the Command Palette and you'll see some different options in a pull-down menu. Choose the Terraform: Preview Graph option. Select graph type 'plan'.

.center[![:scale 80%](images/preview_graph.png)]

---
name: terraform-graph-3
Terraform Graph
-------------------------
<br><br><br>
You'll see a graph pop up in a new tab. This is a map of all the resources and dependencies that Terraform is keeping track of.

.center[![:scale 80%](images/resource_graph.png)]

???
You might have noticed that we have a bunch of variables that we aren't using yet. Don't worry, we will use them as the workshop progresses. You can click on any of the nodes in the graph to jump to the specific part of your code where it is being referenced. Any time you want to update the graph simply use the Command Palette to regenerate it.

---
name: terraform-apply
Terraform Apply
-------------------------
Run the `terraform apply` command to execute the code and build a resource group. Type 'yes' when it prompts you to continue.

Command:
```powershell
terraform apply
```

Output:
```tex
...
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  Enter a value: yes

  azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop: Creating...
  location: "" => "centralus"
  name:     "" => "yourname-vault-workshop"
  tags.%:   "" => "<computed>"
azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop: Creation complete after 1s (ID: /subscriptions/c0a607b2-6372-4ef3-abdb-...ourceGroups/yourname-vault-workshop)

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

---
name: terraform-plan-again
Terraform Plan - Repeat
-------------------------
Run the `terraform plan` command again and see what happens.

Command:
```powershell
terraform plan
```

Output:
```tex
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop: Refreshing state... (ID: /subscriptions/c0a607b2-6372-4ef3-abdb-...ourceGroups/yourname-vault-workshop)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
configuration and real physical resources that exist. As a result, no
actions need to be performed.
```

???
Terraform is sometimes called idempotent. This means it keeps track of what you built, and if something is already in the correct state Terraform will leave it alone.

---
name: chapter-3a-lab
Lab Exercise 3a: Change Your Location
-------------------------
Change the location variable in your terraform.tfvars file to a different Azure location. Re-run the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands. What happens?

---
name: chapter-3a-lab-answer
Lab Exercise 3a: Answer
-------------------------
When you changed your location variable, Terraform detected a difference between your current settings and what you built before. Terraform can destroy and recreate resources as you make changes to your code. Some resources can be changed in place.

```tex
Terraform will perform the following actions:

-/+ azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop (new resource required)
      id:       "/subscriptions/c0a607b2-6372-4ef3-abdb-dbe52a7b56ba/resourceGroups/yourname-vault-workshop" => <computed> (forces new resource)
      location: "uksouth" => "uscentral" (forces new resource)
      name:     "yourname-vault-workshop" => "yourname-vault-workshop"
      tags.%:   "0" => <computed>


Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
```

---
name: terraform-destroy
Terraform Destroy
-------------------------
Run the `terraform destroy` command to delete your resource group.

Command:
```powershell
terraform destroy
```

Output:
```tex
Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

Destroy complete! Resources: 0 destroyed.
```

---
name: we-can-rebuild-him
We Can Rebuild Him
-------------------------
Reset your location variable to your nearest Azure location. This time you can skip straight to `terraform apply`. Use the `-auto-approve` flag this time to avoid having to type 'yes'.

Command:
```powershell
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Output:
```tex
azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop: Creating...
  location: "" => "centralus"
  name:     "" => "yourname-vault-workshop"
  tags.%:   "" => "<computed>"
azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop: Creation complete after 1s (ID: /subscriptions/c0a607b2-6372-4ef3-abdb-...ourceGroups/yourname-vault-workshop)

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

---
name: chapter-3b-lab
Lab Exercise 3b: Tag Your Resource Group
-------------------------
Read the documentation for the `azurerm_resource_group` resource and learn how to add tags to the resource group:

https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/resource_group.html

Edit your main.tf file and add a tag to the resource. Set the name of the tag to 'environment' and the value to 'Production'.

---
name: chapter-3b-lab-answer
Lab Exercise 3b: Answer
-------------------------
Adding and removing tags is a non-destructive action, therefore Terraform is able to make these changes in-place, without destroying your resource group. Your main.tf file should look like this:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "vaultworkshop" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-vault-workshop"
  location = "${var.location}"

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

Note how the tag is added by modifying the existing resource:
```tex
azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop: Modifying... (ID: /subscriptions/c0a607b2-6372-4ef3-abdb-...ourceGroups/yourname-vault-workshop)
  tags.%:           "0" => "1"
  tags.environment: "" => "Production"
azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop: Modifications complete after 0s (ID: /subscriptions/c0a607b2-6372-4ef3-abdb-...ourceGroups/yourname-vault-workshop)
```

---
name: add-virtual-network
Add a Virtual Network
-------------------------
Let's add a virtual network. Scroll down in the main.tf file until you find the azurerm_virtual_network resource. Uncomment it and save the file.

```terraform
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-vnet"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.location}"
  address_space       = ["${var.address_space}"]
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.name}"
}
```
Note the syntax for ensuring that this virtual network is placed into the resource group we created earlier.

Optional: regenerate the Terraform Graph to see how it changes.

Terraform Apply
-------------------------
Run the `terraform apply` command again to build the virtual network.

Command:
```powershell
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Output:
```tex

Lab Exercise 3c: Build the Lab Environment
-------------------------
Go through the rest of the **main.tf** file and uncomment all of the terraform resources. 

Alternatively, you can copy all of the contents of the **main.tf.codeonly** file into your **main.tf** file. Just make sure you overwrite the entire file and save it.

Run `terraform apply` again to build out the rest of your lab environment.

???
Note the dependency in the `data` block that forces terraform to wait until the Virtual Machine is fully provisioned and has a Public IP address before proceeding. Without that `depends_on` parameter the run may sometimes fail.

name: chapter-3c-lab-answer
Lab Exercise 3c: Answer
-------------------------
If you copied all the code over from **main.tf.codeonly** into **main.tf** it should look like this:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "vaultworkshop" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-vault-workshop"
  location = "${var.location}"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-vnet"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.location}"
  address_space       = ["${var.address_space}"]
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.name}"
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "subnet" {
  name                 = "${var.prefix}-subnet"
  virtual_network_name = "${azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name}"
  resource_group_name  = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.name}"
  address_prefix       = "${var.subnet_prefix}"
}
...
```

Organizing Your Terraform Code

Organize Your Terraform Code
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/terraform_config_files.png)]
You should have three files that end in the \*.tf extension on your workstation. The convention is to have a main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf. You may add more tf files if you wish.

---
name: terraform-main
The Main File
-------------------------
The first file is called main.tf. This is where you normally store your terraform code. With larger, more complex infrastructure you might break this up across several files.

```powershell
# This is the main.tf file.
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "vaultworkshop" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-vault-workshop"
  location = "${var.location}"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-vnet"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.location}"
  address_space       = ["${var.address_space}"]
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.name}"
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "subnet" {
  name                 = "${var.prefix}-subnet"
  virtual_network_name = "${azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name}"
  resource_group_name  = "${azurerm_resource_group.vaultworkshop.name}"
  address_prefix       = "${var.subnet_prefix}"
}
```

---
name: terraform-variables
The Variables File
-------------------------
The second file is called variables.tf. This is where you define your variables and optionally set some defaults.

```powershell
variable "prefix" {
  description = "This prefix will be included in the name of most resources."
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The region where the virtual network is created."
  default     = "centralus"
}

variable "address_space" {
  description = "The address space that is used by the virtual network. You can supply more than one address space. Changing this forces a new resource to be created."
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

variable "subnet_prefix" {
  description = "The address prefix to use for the subnet."
  default     = "10.0.10.0/24"
}
```

---
name: terraform-outputs
The Outputs File
-------------------------
The outputs file is where you configure any messages or data you want to show at the end of a terraform apply.

```terraform
output "Vault_Server_URL" {
  value = "http://${azurerm_public_ip.vault-pip.fqdn}:8200"
}

output "MySQL_Server_FQDN" {
  value = "${azurerm_mysql_server.mysql.fqdn}"
}

output "Instructions" {
  value = <<SHELLCOMMANDS

##############################################################################
# Connect to your Linux Virtual Machine
#
# Run the command below to SSH into your server. You can also use PuTTY or any
# other SSH client. Your password is: ${var.admin_password}
##############################################################################

ssh ${var.admin_username}@${azurerm_public_ip.vault-pip.fqdn}

SHELLCOMMANDS
}
```

---
name: terraform-outputs
The Outputs File
-------------------------
Open up the outputs.tf file in Visual Studio Code. Uncomment lines 11-32. Save the file.

```terraform
output "Vault_Server_URL" {
  value = "http://${azurerm_public_ip.vault-pip.fqdn}:8200"
}

output "MySQL_Server_FQDN" {
  value = "${azurerm_mysql_server.mysql.fqdn}"
}

output "Instructions" {
  value = <<SHELLCOMMANDS

##############################################################################
# Connect to your Linux Virtual Machine
#
# Run the command below to SSH into your server. You can also use PuTTY or any
# other SSH client. Your password is: ${var.admin_password}
##############################################################################

ssh ${var.admin_username}@${azurerm_public_ip.vault-pip.fqdn}

SHELLCOMMANDS
}
```
???
The bit with SHELLCOMMANDS is called a heredoc. This is how you add multiple lines or a paragraph of text to your outputs.

---
name: terraform-refresh
Terraform Refresh
-------------------------
Run the `terraform refresh` command again to show the outputs. You will also see these outputs every time you run `terraform apply`.

Command:
```powershell
terraform refresh
```

Output:
```tex
Outputs:

Instructions =
##############################################################################
# Connect to your Linux Virtual Machine
#
# Run the command below to SSH into your server. You can also use PuTTY or any
# other SSH client. Your password is: Password123!
##############################################################################

ssh hashicorp@yourname.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com

MySQL_Server_FQDN = yourname-mysql-server.mysql.database.azure.com
Vault_Server_URL = http://yourname.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com:8200
```

---
name: terraform-output
Terraform Output
-------------------------
If you just want to see the outputs again, use the `terraform output` subcommand.

Command:
```powershell
terraform output
```

Output:
```tex
Outputs:

Instructions =
##############################################################################
# Connect to your Linux Virtual Machine
#
# Run the command below to SSH into your server. You can also use PuTTY or any
# other SSH client. Your password is: Password123!
##############################################################################

ssh hashicorp@yourname.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com

MySQL_Server_FQDN = yourname-mysql-server.mysql.database.azure.com
Vault_Server_URL = http://yourname.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com:8200
```

---
name: terraform-output-2
Terraform Output - Single Value
-------------------------
<br><br><br><br>
If you only want to fetch one of the outputs, use this syntax:

Command:
```powershell
terraform output Vault_Server_URL
```

Output:
```tex
http://yourname.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com:8200
```

name: chapter-4-lab
Lab Exercise 4: Break main.tf into smaller files
-------------------------
Take the azurerm_virtual_machine resource out of main.tf and put it into its own file called application.tf. Save both files. Run `terraform apply` again. What happens?

---
name: chapter-4-lab-answer
Lab Exercise 4: Answer
-------------------------
If you break a large *.tf file down into smaller ones, Terraform doesn't mind. It simply crawls through the directory looking for anything that ends in a .tf extension. All resources in all tf files will be compiled together onto the resource graph before the apply is run.

If you want to exclude some tf files from being run, simply rename them with a different extension or move them into another directory.

???
Some extra notes:

Terraform will *not* crawl into subdirectories looking for tf files. There's also no way to tell terraform which specific tf files to run or not run. The default behavior is to parse any file ending with the .tf or .tfvars extensions in the current directory.
